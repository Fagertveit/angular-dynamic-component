# Angular Dynamic Component POC

This project was created to experiment and research how to handle dynamic components within an Angular app. The project is base on having two different forms that can be used within a dynamic component base on a service configuration. To gain more insight into the solution, please pull the repo and start it. It's based on a regular angular-cli setup, so the instructions bellow will be applicable for the solution.
